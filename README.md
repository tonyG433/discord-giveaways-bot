# 🎉 Simple giveaways
This is a bot that provides all the necessary utilities to run a giveaway in Discord. The bot is built on top of [my discord.js v14 discord bot template](https://github.com/tonyG433/DiscordBotTemplate) and uses [discord-giveaways](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-giveaways) to handle most of the giveaway stuff.

# 💻 Setting the bot up

First, clone this github project
```sh
git clone
```
Next up you will have to install all the dependencies by running 
```sh
npm install
```
Then, you are going to create a file with the name config.json. Copy and paste the example bellow.
```json
{
  "token": "BotToken",
  "devs": ["DevId1", "DevId2"],
  "clientId": "BotClientID"
}
```
- token - your bot's token, acquired in the developer portal
- devs - the ID's of the bot developer(s)
- clientID - The bot's client ID, can be acquired from the developer portal

In order to keep track of the giveaways, discord-giveaways uses a json file. Create a file name giveaways.json and put in an empty array.
```json
[]
```

You are all set to run the bot now. Have fun!
```sh
npm run start
```

> ⚠️ Bear in mind that you must be using Node.js v16.9.0 or higher!
